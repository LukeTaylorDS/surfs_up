Analyzing weather on the Hawaiian island where we want to open up a surf shop on. I will be using jupyter notebook, vscode, python, and SQLite.

## Overview
The analysis aims to compare weather conditions in June and December in Oahu using historical temperature data. Results include mean temperature, standard deviation, minimum and maximum temperatures, and percentiles.

## Results

June: Higher mean temperature (74.944118) compared to December (71.041529).
December: Larger standard deviation (3.745920) compared to June (3.257417).
June: Higher maximum temperature (85) compared to December (83).
December: Lower minimum temperature (56) compared to June (64).
June: Higher quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) compared to December.

## Summary
June tends to have higher average temperatures and less temperature variability compared to December in Oahu. Further analysis on precipitation and wind patterns is recommended to better understand weather trends and assess the sustainability of the surf and ice cream shop business throughout the year.
